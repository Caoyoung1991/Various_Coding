CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

Initial below to "sign" the above statement:

----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:

If percentage of each possibility rounded to the nearest one percent, 
there would be some inaccuracy of the result, such as, we add every 
percentage of each possibility, the result maybe 99% instead of 100%.
On the other hand, if we use 100% to minus the other two possibilities,
the result may seems to be correct, but it isn't came out by real calculation.

----------------------------------------------
ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1. The probability of two heads, one head and one tail and two tails is 25%, 50%,25% respectively.
   Because we have two coins, we can name them coin1 and coin2. Consider one head and one tail, 
   coin1 could be head and coin2 could be tail,on contrary, coin1 could be tail and coin2 could be 
   head.So the probability of one head and one tail could be two times of the other two.

2. By 5000 trials, 2%
   By 10000 trials, 0-1%
   So, about 500~10000 trials, I can get results within 1% of these probabilities.

3. My program can do Integer.MAX(which means the maxim of int type in java) trials.
   If we input a number bigger than Integer.MAX, it will overflow.
